# Brainstorm a Feature or Improvement

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating brainstorm documents.

Brainstorming helps answer **WHAT** to build through collaborative dialogue. It precedes `/workshop:plan`, which answers **HOW** to build it.

**Process knowledge (inline):** Good brainstorming means asking one question at a time, preferring multiple choice when natural options exist, and applying YAGNI — prefer the simplest approach that meets the need. Start broad (purpose, users) then narrow (constraints, edge cases). Validate assumptions explicitly and confirm success criteria.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** "What would you like to explore? Please describe the feature, problem, or improvement you're thinking about."

Do not proceed until you have a feature description from the user.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Assess Requirements Clarity

Evaluate whether brainstorming is needed based on the feature description.

**Clear requirements indicators:**
- Specific acceptance criteria provided
- Referenced existing patterns to follow
- Described exact expected behavior
- Constrained, well-defined scope

**If requirements are already clear:**
Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to suggest: "Your requirements seem detailed enough to proceed directly to planning. Should I run `/workshop:plan` instead, or would you like to explore the idea further?"

> **Interaction method:** If `AskUserQuestion` is available, use it for all prompts in this skill. If not, present each question as a numbered list and wait for a reply before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Understand the Idea

#### 1.1 Repository Research (Lightweight)

Run a quick repo scan to understand existing patterns:

- Task repo-research-analyst("Understand existing patterns related to: <feature_description>")

Focus on: similar features, established patterns, CLAUDE.md guidance.

#### 1.2 Collaborative Dialogue

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask questions **one at a time**.

**Guidelines:**
- Ask one question at a time — don't overwhelm
- Prefer multiple choice when natural options exist
- Start broad (purpose, users) then narrow (constraints, edge cases)
- Validate assumptions explicitly
- Ask about success criteria
- Apply YAGNI — favor the simplest approach that works

**Exit condition:** Continue until the idea is clear OR user says "proceed"

### Phase 2: Explore Approaches

Propose **2-3 concrete approaches** based on research and conversation.

For each approach, provide:
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- Pros and cons
- When it's best suited

Lead with your recommendation and explain why. Apply YAGNI—prefer simpler solutions.

Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask which approach the user prefers.

### Phase 3: Capture the Design

Write a brainstorm document to `docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-brainstorm.md`.

**Document structure** — key sections:
- **What We're Building** — a concise statement of the feature/improvement
- **Why This Approach** — the chosen approach and rationale (with alternatives considered)
- **Key Decisions** — the decisions made during dialogue
- **Open Questions** — anything still unresolved

Ensure `docs/brainstorms/` directory exists before writing.

**IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding to Phase 4, check if there are any Open Questions listed in the brainstorm document. If there are open questions, YOU MUST ask the user about each one using AskUserQuestion before offering to proceed to planning. Move resolved questions to a "Resolved Questions" section.

### Phase 4: Handoff

Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to present next steps:

**Question:** "Brainstorm captured. What would you like to do next?"

**Options:**
1. **Proceed to planning** - Run `/workshop:plan` (will auto-detect this brainstorm)
2. **Ask more questions** - I have more questions to clarify before moving on
3. **Done for now** - Return later

**If user selects "Ask more questions":** YOU (Claude) return to Phase 1.2 (Collaborative Dialogue) and continue asking the USER questions one at a time to further refine the design. The user wants YOU to probe deeper - ask about edge cases, constraints, preferences, or areas not yet explored. Continue until the user is satisfied, then return to Phase 4.

## Output Summary

When complete, display:

```
Brainstorm complete!

Document: docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-brainstorm.md

Key decisions:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

Next: Run `/workshop:plan` when ready to implement.
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Stay focused on WHAT, not HOW** - Implementation details belong in the plan
- **Ask one question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **Apply YAGNI** - Prefer simpler approaches
- **Keep outputs concise** - 200-300 words per section max

NEVER CODE! Just explore and document decisions.
